1. Program encounters - If there is a non-empty array on encounter type 'ANC' for concept ""High risk" Conditions", then add an observation ""High risk"" = "yes". If not, add ""High risk"" = no.
                        If for child Weight for Height Status == "SAM" or  Weight for age Status == "Severely Underweight", then add an observation ""High risk"" = "yes". If not, add ""High risk"" = no.

-- for pregnancy
update program_encounter check "High risk" Conditions(coded concept) column
if size_of("High risk" Conditions) > 0
    set "High risk" as yes
else
    set "High risk" as no

-- for child
update program_encounter
check if Weight for Height Status == "SAM" or  Weight for age Status == "Severely Underweight"
    set "High risk" as yes
else
    set "High risk" as no

2. Program enrolment - Populate the latest (by encounter date time) value of "High risk" in program encounters of type ANC to the program enrolment
                       for child take child Followup

-- for pregnancy and for child
write a cte with row_number patition via encounter_date_time desc
take row_number = 1 and join with program enrolment
update program enrolment
    set enrolment "High risk"  same as encounter "High risk"

3. Program enrolment - If "High risk" not set for it then set as "High risk" no by default

update program_enrolment set "High risk" as no
     if "High risk" not available


4. Individual - Populate the latest (by enrolment date time) value of "High risk" from program enrolment into observations of registration

write a cte to with row_number partition via enrolment_date_time desc
take row_number = 1 and join individual
update individual
     set  individual  "High risk" same as enrolment "High risk"

5. Individual - If "High risk" not available then set as "High risk" no

update individual set "High risk" as no
       if "High risk" not available


6. Sync attributes - Populate sync attributes of all individual, program_enrolment and program_encounter tables with the "High risk" observation on individual. Here, do not limit to specific programs or encounter types or voided

--  for individual
update individual
set sync
    if "High risk" as yes then yes
else no

-- for enrolment
update program_enrolment join with individual
set sync
    if individual sync is yes then yes
    else no

-- for encounter
update program_encounter join with individual
set sync
    if individual sync is yes then yes
    else no



7. Group Subject - Set sync concept value as no

update group Subject  
      set sync as no
